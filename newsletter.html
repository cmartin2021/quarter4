			<h2> Bora Bora </h2>
			<p>The small island of Bora Bora (just about 6 miles long and a little more than 2 miles wide) overflows with beauty. A dormant volcano rises up at its center and fans out into lush jungle before spilling into an aquamarine lagoon. In fact, author James Michener, who wrote "Tales of the South Pacific," called Bora Bora "the most beautiful island in the world." The 18th-century British explorer James Cook even coined it as the "Pearl of the Pacific." The very definition of a tropical getaway, blissful Bora Bora abounds with luxurious resorts, sunny skies, warm waters and friendly locals. 
			And as you might've already guessed, the main industry on this petite island in French Polynesia and its swarm of tiny motu (islands) is tourism. To that end, you can snorkel, explore Vaitape (Bora Bora's main port), hike Mount Otemanu and more. But there's a catch: Bora Bora is expensive – very expensive. In short, visit Bora Bora for natural beauty, visit for utter relaxation and visit if you have the money.</p>

			<h2> The Bahamas </h2>
			<p> The roughly 700 islands that make up the Bahamas lure millions of visitors to their white-washed shores, duty-free shops, fishing and scuba diving excursions and luxurious accommodations each year. Families that flock here tend to indulge in the diversions of Atlantis, Paradise Island and other mega resorts, but this diverse island chain also offers a range of activities away from the hotel zone. Nature enthusiasts can explore pristine protected areas like the Leon Levy Native Plant Preserve (on Eleuthera) and Lucayan National Park (on Grand Bahama Island) or take it easy at one of the country's many beaches or private islands. Bargain hunters, meanwhile, can patrol the marketplaces in Nassau (the country's capital), in Freeport and on Paradise Island for the best duty-free deals. And for history buffs, ruins and artifacts from the colonial era and indigenous peoples like the Lucayan and Arawak Indians can be found on San Salvador, Cat Island and other Bahamian islands. It's no wonder why the Bahamas has become a popular vacation destination.</p>

	<div class="c1"> <h2>Walt Disney World Resort</h2>
		<p> Whatever you’re envisioning, think bigger. With four theme parks, two water parks, multiple golf courses, a sports complex as well as 25 hotels and countless restaurants, it’s less a vacation destination and more of a city sprawl with Mickey Mouse as mayor, as ends of the property span as far as a half-hour drive. Unlike Disneyland, this theme park behemoth is impossible to conquer in one day, so prepare to pace yourself.</p>

	<div class="c2"> <h2> Universal Studios Orlando</h2><p>
			Florida may be jam-packed with theme parks, but no vacation is complete without a trip to Universal Orlando Resort.
			With three individual theme parks, an entertainment district, and five resort hotels themed to everything from decades-old beach resorts to picturesque Italy, there’s a lot to see, whether you’re a complete coaster-phobe or spend half your day inverted upside-down.
			Before you take a dive at Universal’s incredible new water park, load up on “The Simpsons”-themed foods, and tackle the Harry Potter-themed land, you'll need to find the right hotel, get your tickets, and choose some rides and restaurants for your trip to this massive destination.</p>

		<div class="c3"> <h2> Legoland Florida </h2> <p>
			LEGOLAND Florida is exactly what it sounds like yet so much more! A place dedicated to everybody's favorite brick, LEGOLAND Florida brings the world of LEGO to life like you could never imagine. You truly feel like you're walking through lands of actual LEGO creations with your favorite worlds brought to life in a 150-acre interactive theme park full of unique attractions, experiences, dining, shopping and so much more.
			The most important thing to note about LEGOLAND Florida is that it is designed for tadpoles up to age 12. What does this mean? Rides are geared toward the thrill level and interest of little ones, rather than adults. We wouldn't recommend LEGOLAND for adults without kiddos unless you're a huge LEGO fan.
			LEGOLAND Florida is on the property of what used to be Cypress Gardens, and there is still an area dedicated to the former park. This is actually Mommy Frog's favorite place! Explore lush landscapes with huge trees, cool plants and a gorgeous gazebo for a quick getaway, or the perfect picnic location.
			LEGOLAND Florida is divided into multiple lands inspired by different LEGO product lines and destinations: The Beginning, Fun Town, Miniland, Duplo Valley, LEGO Kingdoms, Land of Adventure, LEGO City, Imagination Zone, LEGO Technic, Pirates' Cove, Cypress Gardens, Heartlake City and LEGO Ninjago World.

			<div class="c4"> <h2> Sea-World Orlando</h2> <p> SeaWorld is one of the last maritime amusement parks left in the nation. It’s an aquatic park in Orlando that can be done as a half-day or whole-day park. This depends on your goals for that day. SeaWorld Orlando is quite stunning and is in the same family as Busch Gardens.
			When approaching the park gates, you’ll see a watery entrance reminding you of a gorgeous bay in San Diego. Once in the gates, you experience watery thrills, hear tropical noises, and see colorful topiary displays.
			SeaWorld usually opens at 9:00 a.m. and closes at 6:00 p.m.; however, during the peak summer days the park may be open until 10:00 p.m.Remember when planning your trip, always check the park’s website or mobile app for the current hours and wait times.SeaWorld was one of the first theme parks I visited as a child, so it will always have a special place in my heart. It was one of the few parks families could budget modestly for and have a great time.</p>

		<div><h2> Efteling</h2> <p>
		Efteling is a theme park in North Brabant in the Netherlands. It's themed around fairy tales and is the largest theme park in the Benelux and one of the most-visited in Europe.
		Although very suited to families with children, it is not childish: Efteling provides more that enough to do for any age category for at least an entire day.Originally Efteling catered towards children with a fairy tale theme, nowadays Efteling appeals to young and old with its cultural, romantic and nostalgic theme and its variety of amusement rides. In over fifty years, Efteling has evolved from a general nature park with playground and unique Fairy Tale Forest, into a full-size theme park along the lines of Disneyland.Efteling is famous for its great attention to detail, the green atmosphere and excellent dark rides. With four million visitors annually, it's in the top of European theme parks right after the Disney parks in France and Europa Park in Germany.The base for the park as it is now was created in 1950. Artist Anton Pieck and inventor Peter Reijnders set out to create a quality fairy tale forest. Pieck's remarkable, nostalgic style combined with Reijnders' ingenuity and the use of "real" materials created an enchanting forest that immediately profiled Efteling as a national attraction upon its opening in 1952. The style set by Pieck has been the base for many developments after that, setting the park apart.The most important milestones in its development: 1933: A catholic complex of sporting facilities is founded.
		1952: The park opens its Fairy Tale Forest, which instantly becomes a tourist hit; this is considered the start of the current Efteling.1978: The Haunted Castle is the first "large scale" attraction.1980: Efteling starts to build thrill-rides (rollercoasters and the like) to appeal to a larger audience.1987: Efteling returns to its roots with building large attractions but always themed around the (broad) fairy tales and myths theme; continues until today.1999: Start of Winter Efteling. The goal is to be open year round.2004: Efteling actively works on expansion with more lodging and facilities, a theatre with musical productions and a golf course.2010: The Efteling gets opened year-round from April 1 and onwards. The park is from now opened everyday in November–March.

		<div><h2> Toyko, Japan</h2> <p>Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century, Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal government there. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's most populous cities. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945.Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums, historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.</p></div>
		<div> <h2> Hawaii</h2> <p>From snowcapped volcanoes to rainforests to lava-rock deserts, Hawaii is much more than the parade of high-rise hotels that hug glorious Waikiki Beach. The push and pull between highly developed tourist apex, ancient Polynesian culture, and natural paradise is palpable in the complex 50th state. Add to that the vestiges of “old” (pre–1959 statehood) Hawaii—the one where mai tais are poured in a salty seaside shack to the tune of hapa haole (Hawaiian music with English lyrics), and you have a destination with a rich, complex identity. But everywhere the generous spirit of “aloha” is infectious, making lifetime repeat visitors of many who set foot on these exotic, yet very American, islands.Located in the Pacific Ocean west of California, Hawaii is the only state to be completely surrounded by water. It consists of six main islands—the Big Island, Maui, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, and Lanai. Cascading waterfalls, black-sand beaches, and rugged canyons make Hawaii travel great for relaxation or adventure. And getting around is easy—there's one major airport and several smaller ones. This Hawaii travel guide is filled with ideas to kick-start your vacation planning.
